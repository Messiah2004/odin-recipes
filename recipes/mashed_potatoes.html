        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Don't mashed-potatoes just hit <em>different</em> at restaurants? Perhaps the chef at Olive Garden carries a certain genius that can not be copied, or perhaps most restaurants don't serve the typical creamy mashed potatoes, but rather something quite <em>different</em>. Hence, we will be making garlic restaurant-style mashed potatoes. </p>
