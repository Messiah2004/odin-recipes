        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you want to twist and shout, but the nearest Hard Rock Cafe is far and far, then you can still rock hard without a hard drive. Pardon my cheesy style. Just like the <a href="./mashed_potatoes.html"><em>mashed potatoes</em></a>, Hard Rock Cafe's twisted mac-and-cheese is among the favorite things that I ate in Spain. This copycat recipe is in honor to the fake sellers down by the pigeon park in La Rambla. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb Cavatappi Pasta</li>
            <li>2/3 Cup Milk</li>
            <li>8oz Velveeta Cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/4 Cup Cheddar Cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup Monterey Jack Cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground Cayenne Pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup roasted Bell Pepper</li>
            <li>4 tsp Italian Bread Crumbs</li>
            <li>4 tsp grated Parmesan Cheese</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saucepan, bring salted water to boil to cook your cavatappi. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
            <li>To the same saucepan, add the milk, Velveeta, cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, cayenne pepper and black pepper and heat over low for about 10 minutes until the cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.</li>
            <li>Add in the cooked pasta and roasted pepper to the pan, and then toss to coat the pasta.</li>
            <li>To a small bowl, add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese and parsley and toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Pour your pasta into a serving bowl and then sprinkle Parmesan breadcrumbs over the top.</li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
        </ol>
